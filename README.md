# ClassroomManagerWebsite

Website I built as an exercise in learning web development, used Flask for server and database functionality.

Allows a user to add and delete students to different courses and view all students enrolled in each course as well as the teacher for the course.

New courses and teachers are added via python script load_databases.py, which needs to be run at least once before running server.py for the 1st time.
